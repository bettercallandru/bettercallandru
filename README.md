# Adrian Mauricio Salgado

Frontend Developer focused on building scalable, high-performance web applications with React and TypeScript.

With 3+ years of experience contributing to enterprise financial platforms operating across 15+ countries in Latin America, I have worked on UI modernization, frontend architecture improvements, and production-ready feature development within complex systems.

I am particularly interested in designing maintainable component-based architectures, improving rendering performance, and building frontend systems that scale with product growth.
